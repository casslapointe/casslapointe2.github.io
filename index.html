    <h2>HC3</h2>
    <p>In our research, we found that the NYC Clean Heat Program incorporates renewable energy sources into the city through heat pumps.</p>
    <p>Moreover, we learned that the DEP Boiler Registration and Greener Greater Buildings Plan are being used to try and regulate corporate energy usage as well as improve air quality.</p>
    <h2>HC4</h2>
    <p>I think what shocked me most was, despite all of the measures taken to try and improve our energy usage and overall environemtn, we still have a LONG way to go. So few buildings are making significant strides to lower or improve their usage, and, despite residential AC units providing a problem, it's mostly big corporations who are responsible.</p>
